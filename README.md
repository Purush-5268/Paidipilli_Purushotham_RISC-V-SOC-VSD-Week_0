# üñ•Ô∏è My Journey in the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program

Welcome! to my journey through the **VLSI System Design (VSD) RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) Tapeout Program**. My primary goal is to enhance my practical skills in the complete SoC design flow, covering everything from digital logic design to the final physical layout.

> This intensive program provides hands-on training in designing a complete SoC, taking a concept from a Register Transfer Level (RTL) description down to the GDSII file format required for fabrication. As part of a massive national initiative, it leverages open-source EDA tools to empower thousands of engineers and students to contribute to India's growing semiconductor ecosystem.

## üìÖ Week 0: Foundation and Tool Setup

The first week was dedicated to establishing a robust development environment by installing and verifying the essential open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools.

| Task   | Core Tools Installed                               | Status |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------- | :----: |
| **0** | `Icarus Verilog` (Simulation), `Yosys` (Synthesis), `GTKWave` (Waveform Viewing) |   ‚úÖ   |

> üìù **Installation Guide:** For a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on how I installed and configured these tools on my system, please see the [**dedicated README in the Week 0 folder.**](https://github.com/Purush-5268/Paidipilli_Purushotham_RISC-V-SOC-VSD-Week_0/blob/main/Lab%20Snapshots/README.md)


### üåü Key Learnings from this Stage
- Gained hands-on experience configuring a Linux environment for digital design work.
- Developed a foundational understanding of the role each tool plays in the RTL-to-GDSII flow.
- Successfully compiled and simulated a test Verilog module to ensure the toolchain was fully operational.
