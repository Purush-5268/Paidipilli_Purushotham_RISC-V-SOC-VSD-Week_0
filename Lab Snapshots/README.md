### ✅ **Installation & Verification Log**

The following sections detail the commands executed for each tool and provide dedicated space for verification screenshots.

#### **Tool 1: 🔬 Yosys (Synthesis Tool)**

Yosys, the core synthesis framework, was compiled and installed from its latest source code.

**📝 Commands Executed:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
git clone [https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git)
cd yosys
sudo apt install make               # Ensure 'make' is available
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential clang bison flex \
    libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev git \
    graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 libboost-system-dev \
    libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev
make config-gcc
git submodule update --init --recursive # Crucial step for 'abc'
make 
sudo make install
````
